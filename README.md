# Lite-Neural-Networks

---

A small lite weight JS library for your fun project

Inspried by Tensorflow.js but faster in terms of multiple Neural Networks,TF.js works superb when it comes to single Neural Network and allows hardware acceleration. But when used for creating multiple Neural Networks for applications under Genetic Algorithm or Multiple Simulation it kind of lags or consume high resources.

Lite Neural Networks Library allows you to create multiple Neural Networks and perform opeartions on them iteratively
